      <description>In this series of blogposts, we look at some models of clinical state. The motivation is to document exploratory work with a colleague (Nick Meyer, who runs the SleepSight study) as we try and apply some theoretical ideas – for example (Nelson et al. 2017; Scheffer et al. 2009) – to ‘real-life’ data. This problem is interesting because the psychiatric literature more often than not uses an aggregate measure of either state or trajectory, and sometimes, there is no distinction made between the person’s clinical state, a measurement of this state and an ‘outcome’.</description>

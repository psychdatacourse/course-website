Instructions for creating new content:

1) Add a new "chapter" == adding a directory and a sidebar menu item

	1 -- Navigate to the root (psychdatacourse)

	2 -- hugo new --kind <chaptername>/_index.md

		This creates a directory called <chaptername> and builds a template _index.md


2) Open RStudio, open the psychdatacourse project (.Rproj) file

3) Make sure you require(blogdown)

4) In RStudio, with blogdown running:

	1 -- File -> New File -> Create a new R Markdown file in 

		psychdatacourse/content/<chaptername>/

	... and call it <chaptername>-part-X

	... where X is the part number (if in multiple pages/parts)

	2. Ensure that this new file is a .Rmd file (NOT RMarkdown)

5) blogdown::build_site()

6) blogdown::serve_site()

7) Open web browser and navigate to localhost (build_site() shows the http URL for this in the console

7) With the server running, you can then go and edit the .Rmd file and the webpage / site auto updates on each save of the .Rmd
